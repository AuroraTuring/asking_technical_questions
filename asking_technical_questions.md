1. What are the steps you will take when asking a technical question? 
You should include the following: 
What were you trying to do? 
What were you expecting to happen? 
What happened instead? 
What have you attempted/googled/read to find a solution? 

2. We lay out these steps in a particular order. What do you think the reasoning behind this might be? 
In this order, it helps paint a picture of what was expected and then what happened instead, with the asker sharing what they've already done, creating a great bridge to ask for help.

3. How will you refer back to this question-asking strategy while in Mods 1 and beyond? (ex: add these steps to your notes, write them on a sticky note, etc.) 
I will hae a spot for them in my notes and have the relevant Turing mod 0 page bookmarked for later reference.
